# 🌍🗣️ Welcome to Panlingo! 🧠💡

Hey there, language enthusiast! 👋 Ready to embark on a linguistic journey that's out of this world? 🚀 Panlingo is here to revolutionize the way you learn languages. Buckle up, because this is going to be one emotionally intelligent, culturally savvy ride! 🎢

## 🌟 What Makes Panlingo Special?

Imagine if your language app had the emotional intelligence of a therapist, and the cultural awareness of a globetrotter. Well, stop imagining - that's Panlingo! 🧳🌎

- 📚 Comprehensive language courses (because "hello" and "where's the bathroom?" just don't cut it anymore)
- 🧠 Emotional intelligence training (learn to say "I'm hangry" in 17 languages!)
- 🏺 Cultural context learning (avoid those socially embarrassing situations)
- 🎮 Gamified learning experience (who said learning can't be as addictive as your favorite mobile game?)
- 🧭 Personalized learning paths (because you're unique, and your learning should be too)
- 🌐 Real-world application tools (impress locals, not just your language teacher)

## 🛠️ Our Secret Sauce (Tech Stack)

- 👩‍💻 Frontend: React.js (making UIs as smooth as your future multilingual conversations)
- 🏗️ Backend: Java Spring Boot (robust like your commitment to learning)
- ☁️ Serverless: AWS Lambda (because servers are a thing of the past!)
- 🗄️ Database: Amazon DynamoDB (flexible like your tongue will be)
- 🗂️ Storage: Amazon S3 (storing knowledge like your soon-to-be multilingual brain)
- 🤖 Machine Learning: AWS SageMaker (AI almost as smart as you'll be after using Panlingo)
- 🏗️ Infrastructure as Code: AWS CloudFormation (because we believe in treating our infrastructure like royalty)

### 🧰 Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or later) - Your ticket to the frontend fun 🎟️
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later - The backend backstage pass 🎭
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials - Your cloud nine key 🔑

### 🏗️ Building Your Linguistic Launchpad

1. Clone the repository (bring Panlingo to your local universe):
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/CloudMikhail/panlingo.git
   cd panlingo
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies (prepare for UI liftoff):
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. Install backend dependencies (fuel up the language engines):
   ```
   cd ../backend
   ./mvnw install
   ```

### 🎬 Lights, Camera, Action!

1. Start the frontend development server (raise the curtain):
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

2. Start the backend server (cue the backstage magic):
   ```
   cd backend
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```
